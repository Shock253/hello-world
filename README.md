# hello-world
The repository for any little knicks and knacks, random ideas, discussions, and other miscelaneous topics.
My name is Ethan, and i'm a beginning engineering student interested in doing some game develompent projects. I've seen github in action in a corporate setting, and I thought it might be worth a try.
